wake up
brush my teeth
get out of my pajamas
shower quickly
get dressed
go downstairs
eat ice cubes for 3 minutes
pack my bag for school
get in the car
changing my mask
eat breakfast
drink milk
play games on my phone
put on my shoes
put on my backpack
leave the car
walk up the escalator
walk to my class room and sit there for 10-20 minutes
